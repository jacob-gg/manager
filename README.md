- `dup_detect()`: Identifies duplicated values in vectors/columns (beyond what `base::duplicated` offers) and assists in removing them
- `golem()`: Retrieves geolocation data for IP addresses
- `winograd()`: Fetches a Winograd schema (from [here](https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WSCollection.html)) for use in survey bot detection--or for anything else
